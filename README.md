# earning-manipulation-detection-by-machine-learning-algorithm


An indian loan provider in a private bank is asking for help from a consulting company to find out whethere there are any earning manipulation probabilities for those small business. As a result, by collecting the data from 1200+ companies in indian, we are trying to go through these quesitions to build up a machine learning model which could help us to detect any earning manipulation. Also, evaluate the performance of the data.( AdaBoosting, RandomForest should be tested over the dataset)


introdution of the dataset: 
The dataset contains 14 variables and unfortunately the dataset is unbalance with 1200 non-manipulators and 39 manipulators in the past
The basic idea is that we are trying to use Beineish Model to detect any manipulation possibilities.


Here are the questions I am trying to figure out for modeling:
1. Do you think the Beneish model developed in 1999 will still be relevant to Indian data?
2. The number of manipulators is usually much less than non-manipulators (in the accompanying spreadsheet, the percentage of manipulators is less than 4% in the complete data). What kind of modeling problems can one expect when cases in one class are much lower than the other class in a binary classification problem? How can one handle these problems?
3. Use a sample data (220 cases including 39 manipulators) and develop a logistic regression model that can be used by MCA Technologies Private Limited for predicting probability of earnings manipulation.
4. Comment on the model developed; how do you measure the accuracy of the model?
5. What should be the strategy adopted by MCA Technology Solutions to deploy the logistic regression model developed?
6. Based on the models developed in questions 4 and 5, suggest a M-score (Manipulator score) that can be used by regulators to identify potential manipulators. 
7. Develop classification and regression tree (CART) model. What insights do you obtain from the CART model?
8. Develop a logistic regression model using the complete data set (1200 non-manipulators and 39 manipulators), compare the results with the previous logistic regression model.
9. Develop models using machine learning algorithms such as random forest and boosting. compare the outputs from these methods with logistic regression and classification tree. 
10. What will be your final recommendation for predicting earnings manipulators?
